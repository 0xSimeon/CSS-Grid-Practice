# CSS Grid Practice
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/42dd6183-c5fa-4d69-8a0f-64f1a1bb2783/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/frosty-brahmagupta-d78dec/deploys)

Some of my CSS grid practice codes. 
Currently covered basic grid properties like  `display: grid`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-areas`.

I also learnt how to name both `grid lines` and `grid areas`.


`Note`: The pages are currently not mobile-responsive. It's a WIP (_Work in progress!_).
